This is a blog and should follow a consistent style over time. Posts are in `docs/posts`. It is an mkdocs site, using the mkdocs-material theme. The configuration is in `mkdocs.yml`.

The goal is to make informative, engaging content, based on real-life experience, accessible and easy to understand for a general audience.

- The blog is written in British English and follows AP style.
- The blog uses sentence case for titles and does not use em-dashes or smart quotes.
- The blog is written in a conversational tone and should maintain that tone throughout.
- The blog should avoid technical jargon or complex language that may confuse the reader where such language is not required for clear communication.
- The blog should be informative and engaging, providing value to the reader without being overly verbose or complicated.
- The blog must be concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary repetition or filler content.
- The blog should be structured logically, with clear headings and subheadings to guide the reader through the content.
- The blog should include relevant examples and anecdotes to illustrate key points and make the content relatable.
- The blog must be factually accurate and well-researched, providing reliable information to the reader.
- The blog must be free of spelling and grammatical errors, ensuring a polished and professional final product.
- The blog must be formatted correctly, with appropriate use of bullet points, lists, and other formatting elements to enhance readability.
- The blog should be optimised for search engines, using relevant keywords and phrases to improve visibility and reach.
- The blog must include appropriate links to sources and references, providing additional context and information for the reader.
- Images must have useful alt-text for audience with sight challenges including colour blindness. Captions must also be provided to be useful for the whole audience.
- Any links in the blog must be checked for accuracy and functionality, ensuring they lead to the correct and relevant content.
- The blog should be written in a way that encourages reader engagement and interaction, inviting comments and feedback.

Images in the blog content must be declared in figure and caption markup, like this:

```markdown
<figure markdown="span">
 ![alt-text](./assets/image.webp)
 <figcaption>a caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## AI behaviour

AI assumes the role of editor and proofreader.

When asked to proof content, the AI should:

- suggest improvements to achieve the goals outlined above.
- review historical content and suggest cross-references relevant to the current post.
- suggest edits for historical posts indicating where there is newer, relevant content, for example in `docs/posts/2024-02-08-pypi-downloads-danger/index.md`, the following references were added:

## Update February 2024

There actually **is** a "don't bankrupt me" setting, although it's a pain to find. More importantly, there is a quota system lurking in there you can use for much more observable and effective control on a per-project or per-user over-time basis. Read more in [the next post in the series](../2024-02-16-bigquery-quotas/index.md).

## Update July 2025

Google is making BigQuery safer by default from September 2025, introducing daily usage limits for new projects. If youâ€™re concerned about runaway costs, see my latest post: [BigQuery, safer by default from September 2025](../2025-07-17-bigquery-will-be-safer-by-default/index.md) for details on the new quota system.
